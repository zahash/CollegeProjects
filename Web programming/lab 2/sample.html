		<h3> Qualcomm announces Snapdragon 8cx chipset for Windows 10 </h3>
		
		<p> At the Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii, Qualcomm has taken the wraps off its latest chipset intended for Windows 10 computers - the Snapdragon 8cx. This is the successor to the Snapdragon 850, but it's a different beast altogether. </p>
		
		<p> Whereas the 850 was just a modified Snapdragon 845, which is intended for mobile devices, the 8cx is the company's first of a kind SoC built specifically for Windows 10 PCs from the ground up. It's made on a 7nm process and should be in shipping products around the third quarter of next year. </p>

		<p> The company says it will pack twice the performance of the Snapdragon 850, which, to quote Reddit parlance, is big if true. That is because Qualcomm says the 8cx's performance when running native Windows ARM apps should rival that of an Intel Core i5 U-series CPU. The SD850 beat a Core i5-6300U in multi-core benchmark scores and only slightly lagged in single-core scores, so that's certainly believable - obviously the 8cx will need to be compared to a current generation Core i5 8th gen part. </p>

		<h3> Avengers 4 trailer: Here’s what you WILL and WON’T see in the Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans starrer </h3>
		
		<p>Seems just yesterday that fans were heartbroken with tears in their eyes as they walked out of the theatres after watching Avengers: Infinity War. For those unaware, the climax of the film took fans by surprise as Thanos snapped his finger and caused the unthinkable. Since then all fans could do was speculate, anticipate and tirelessly wait to see the next installment of this epic saga. And the wait is finally over the trailer has now been released! </p>
		
		<p> As fellow fans, we wanted to carry on the speculations and theories as to what we will and what we won’t get to see in the first trailer of Avengers 4 and before you bask in the trailer, here's all that was expected to be shown and now shown in the trailer hours before its official launch! </p>

		<p> The dusted characters won’t feature – Not that this should be a surprise for anyone. After all, characters like Spider-Man, Black Panther, Vision, Dr. Strange, etc will be all honky dory and throwing one-liners in the first trailer itself. They are dead, remember? We doubt if any of the dusted characters or the ones killed before the dusting would feature in this trailer. </p>

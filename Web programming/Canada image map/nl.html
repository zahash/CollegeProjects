Pitcher Plant
Queen Victoria suggested using the pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea)—also known as the Indian dipper and the huntsman’s cup—on the colony’s coinage. Newfoundland and Labrador made it an official emblem in 1954.

<h2>Bird:</h2>
Atlantic Puffin
The Atlantic puffin (Fraterculus arctica) is a well-known symbol of Newfoundland and Labrador. Over 95 percent of all the puffins in North America breed on the coasts of the province. The largest colony can be seen in the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve just south of St. John’s.

<h2>Tree:</h2>
Black Spruce
The black spruce (Picea mariana) was designated the provincial tree in November 1993. It is also known as the bog spruce. Although its foliage is bluish-green, it is called the “black” spruce to distinguish it from other types of spruce trees. The black spruce is the most abundant tree in Labrador and appears on the Labrador flag.

<h2>Flower:</h2>
Prairie Lily
Saskatchewan adopted the orange-red lily (Lilium philadelphicum L. var. Andinum), also known as the prairie lily, as its official flower in 1941. The Saskatchewan Natural History Society suggested the flower to a special committee that had been set up to consider the matter.

<h2>Bird:</h2>
Sharp-Tailed Grouse
The sharp-tailed grouse (Pedioecetes phasianellus james), also known as the prairie chicken, is one of Saskatchewan's most popular game birds. Saskatchewan adopted it as the province’s official bird in 1945.

<h2>Tree:</h2>
Paper Birch
The paper birch (Betula papyrifera) can be easily recognized by its papery white bark. First Nations communities used it to make canoes, baskets and utensils. The birch can also be used as a veneer or plywood, and it is a popular choice for furniture. The tree was adopted in 1988 as the province’s official tree, as it is found everywhere in Saskatchewan.

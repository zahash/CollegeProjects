<h2>Flower:</h2>
Purple Violet
New Brunswick adopted the purple violet (Viola palmata, var, cucullata) as its official flower in 1936. The Women’s Institutes, the Lieutenant Governor and, finally, the province’s schoolchildren helped make this choice.

<h2>Bird:</h2>
Black-Capped Chickadee
New Brunswick adopted the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) as its official bird in August 1983, based on a contest run by the provincial federation of naturalists. The small and easily recognized bird is energetic and acrobatic. Its distinctive song is often heard throughout the year, while another high-pitched song is sung to welcome spring.

<h2>Tree:</h2>
Balsam Fir
The province adopted the balsam fir (Abies balsamia) as its official tree on May 1, 1987. The balsam fir is best recognized as a Christmas tree. It can grow up to 20 metres (65 feet) high and is a staple of the province’s lumber industry, as the unusually long wood fibres are perfect for making high-quality paper.

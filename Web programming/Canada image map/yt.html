The floral emblem of Yukon is the magenta-purple fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium), which by late July covers the hills and roadsides.

<h2> Bird: </h2>
<p> Common Raven </p>
Yukon adopted the common raven (Corvus corax) as its official bird in October 1986. The raven, sometimes referred to as the crow, is found throughout Yukon. It is a very intelligent bird, and it has been known to open boxes, use tools and communicate with other animals.

<h2> Tree: </h2>
<p> Sub-Alpine Fir </p>
The sub-alpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) is found in most areas of Yukon. The territory adopted the bird as its symbol in 2001, in part
because of its fame among the territoryâ€™s Aboriginal people for its healing powers. They would boil the needles to make a cold-fighting
tea rich in vitamin C and use the sap to treat lung ailments.

<h2>Flower:</h2>
Wild Rose
Alberta adopted the wild rose (Rosa acicularis) as its official flower in 1930. The editor of an Edmonton newspaper suggested that a provincial floral emblem be selected. The Women’s Institutes took up the suggestion and passed it on to the Department of Education, and the province’s schoolchildren made the final choice.

<h2>Bird:</h2>
Great Horned Owl
Alberta adopted the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) as its official bird on May 3, 1977, following a province-wide children’s vote. The great horned owl lives in Alberta year round and was selected to symbolize the growing concern over threatened wildlife, not only in Alberta, but also throughout the world.

<h2>Tree:</h2>
Lodgepole Pine
The lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) played a significant role in Alberta’s early history. It was used to create the railway ties for the tracks that linked the province to eastern Canada. It was adopted as Alberta’s official tree on May 30, 1984, partly due to the efforts of the Junior Forest Warden Association of Alberta. Today, the lodgepole pine is used for poles, pulp and many other products of Alberta’s forest industry.

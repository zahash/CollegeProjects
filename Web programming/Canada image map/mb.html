<h2>Flower:</h2>
Prairie Crocus
In Manitoba, the prairie crocus (Pulsatilla ludoviciana)—also known as anemone patens, the pasque-flower, the windflower (because of its furry petals) and the gosling plant—was officially adopted as the official flower in 1906. Interest had first been aroused by the Manitoba Horticultural Society. A subsequent vote among schoolchildren put the crocus in first place, the prairie lily second and the wild rose third.

<h2>Bird:</h2>
Great Grey Owl
Manitoba adopted the great grey owl (Strix nebulosa) as its official bird on July 16, 1987. The great grey owl is the largest owl in North America with a wingspan of 1.3 metres (4 feet). The owl can be found across the province year round.

<h2>Tree:</h2>
White Spruce
The white spruce (Picea glauca) is capable of surviving in virtually every climatic and environmental region of Manitoba. It is best known as a traditional Christmas tree, and thus is often cultivated for this purpose.

<h2>Flower:</h2>
White Trillium
Ontario adopted the white trillium (Trillium grandiflorum), also known as the wake-robin and the white lily, as its official flower in 1937. A special committee of botanists recommended it to the Ontario Horticultural Association, which canvassed other horticultural societies in the province, as well as high schools and collegiate institutes, to get their views. In a British botanical work published in 1760, there is a reference to the trillium as “the herb True Love of Canada.”

<h2>Bird:</h2>
Common Loon
Ontario adopted the common loon (Gavia immer) as its official bird on June 23, 1994. The loon is a common sight on many lakes and rivers in the province. In 1987, Canada replaced its $1 bill with a coin, which featured a swimming loon on the tail side. It was quickly nicknamed the “loonie.”

<h2>Tree:</h2>
Eastern White Pine
The eastern white pine (Pinus strobus linnaeus) has been heavily used in Ontario since the pioneer days. The province adopted the tree as its official symbol on May 1, 1984, after much consultation.
